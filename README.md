## InVenta: Responsive Web Application for Sales and Inventory Management

This web application is designed to enhance the management of sales and inventory for a small business, centralizing the visualization of products and tracking sales made by administrators.

### Key Features:
#### 1. User Management:
- **Customers:** Customers can browse through the product catalog using category filters or search for specific items. They can access detailed information about each product to make informed purchasing decisions.
- **Administrators:** In addition to browsing the product catalog, administrators have enhanced capabilities to modify product details and manage inventory. They manually handle sales through a sales cart, which reflects the personalized sales process typical of a small business.

#### 2. Inventory Management:
Administrators can add or edit products from the inventory. They can also adjust stock levels and view real-time product availability to ensure the inventory is always up to date.

#### 3. Manual Sales Cart:

Given the small business context and personalized service approach, administrators use a sales cart to manually conduct transactions. This process allows administrators to select products and finalize the sale directly with the customer, providing a more tailored experience that aligns with the business's needs.

#### 4. Discount Management:

Administrators have tools to create, modify, and assign discounts to specific products, enabling them to adapt promotions to the business's needs. This helps boost sales and implement more effective marketing strategies.

#### 5. Sales History and Analytics:

The application includes a dashboard where administrators can view the full history of sales. This dashboard allows filtering by date and by administrator, providing detailed insights into sales performance and supporting strategic decision-making.

### Benefits:
- **Centralized Information:** All relevant information about inventory, products, and sales is consolidated in one place, making daily business management more straightforward.
- **Optimized Sales Process:** By allowing administrators to manually manage sales, the application respects the personalized nature of the business, enhancing efficiency without sacrificing customer attention.
- **Flexibility and Adaptability:** The responsive interface ensures that the application works well on any device, meeting the needs of both administrators and customers.
